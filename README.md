# NOTES

1. 404 not found errors are mainly due to not linking css/
   html files properly.
 
 
2. X, Y determines the position of the profile picture in 
    relation to the blob. You can change it as much as you need until the image is positioned/centered properly. 
 
 ```
 <image class="home_blob-img" x='35' y='20' xlink:href="assets/img/Profile_picture-Catherine.png"/>
 ```

Next class: start from 50:12 (skills/style.css)
